- To solve this question I begin by introducing an array frequency.
- For each value in List A I decrement the corresponding index value in frequency.
- I then do the same with List B, but instead of decrementing the value I increment it.
- This results in any value missing in List A but present in List B having a positive value in frequency.
- Finally I print all the index values in frequency which are greater than zero.
- This results in the missing elements being printed in ascending order.
