- I begin by storing the sum of all of the on all the vertices in the entire tree.
- By cycling through each node of the tree and calling my depth first search algorithm I am able to calculate the weights of all the sub-trees.
- This means that I can then remove edges and easily calculate the weight difference between the two.
- It is then a simiple case of sorting the results and printing the lowest difference value.
